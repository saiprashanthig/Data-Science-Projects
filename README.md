Welcome to my Data Science repository! 

This repository is a collection of my work in statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. 
Itâ€™s a space where I showcase various algorithms and data science projects that I've developed to tackle real-world problems.

Contents
Statistics: Fundamental and advanced statistical methods for data analysis.
Machine Learning: Implementations of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forests, and clustering techniques.
Deep Learning: Models and architectures for neural networks, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
Data Science Projects: End-to-end projects demonstrating practical applications of data science techniques to real-world datasets.
